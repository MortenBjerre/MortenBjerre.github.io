# Analyzing standardized testing scores of schools in San Francisco

In our research of San Francisco (SF) school performances, we are getting our data from [CAASPP](https://caaspp-elpac.cde.ca.gov/caaspp/ResearchFileList?ps=true&lstTestYear=2019&lstTestType=B&lstCounty=00&lstDistrict=00000&lstSchool=0000000), which is the standardized testing program for the state of California.

### What do the scores mean?

The Scale Score is the score a student achieved on the exam. Contrary to a raw score, the Scale Score takes into account differences in difficulty of the exam from year to year, as well as giving a higher score for answering more difficult, discriminating questions correctly, as explained [here](https://www.caaspp.org/rsc/pdfs/CAASPP.post-test_guide.2018-19.pdf) from the Department of Education for the State of California.
