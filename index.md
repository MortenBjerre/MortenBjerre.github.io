# Analyzing Standardized Testing Scores of Schools in San Francisco

In our research of San Francisco (SF) school performances, we are getting our data from [CAASPP](https://caaspp-elpac.cde.ca.gov/caaspp/ResearchFileList?ps=true&lstTestYear=2019&lstTestType=B&lstCounty=00&lstDistrict=00000&lstSchool=0000000), which is the standardized testing program for the state of California.


# Introduction

Our goal is to find any patterns in the school performances in San Francisco, and to see if there are any connections in these patterns with socio-economic factors. To make sure we have an unbiased, universal metric of school performances, we turn to the CAASPP, the standardized testing program for California. The variable we are examining there is the Mean Scale Score (MSS). 

## What does Mean Scale Score mean?

The Scale Score is the score a student achieved on the exam. Contrary to a raw score, the Scale Score takes into account differences in difficulty of the exam from year to year, as well as giving a higher score for answering more difficult, discriminating questions correctly, as explained [here](https://www.caaspp.org/rsc/pdfs/CAASPP.post-test_guide.2018-19.pdf) from the Department of Education for the State of California.

## Standards

The CAASPP has a standard, which all students should be meeting. There are five categories in relation to this standard, from highest to lowest: 
- Standard exceeded
- Standard met and above
- Standard met
- Standard nearly met
- Standard not met 

# Initial overview of all of San Francisco over all testing years

First, we will take a look at how the MSS looks like for all of San Francisco in general. 

[INSERT LINE PLOT HERE]

There is a general upwards trend of the MSS over time for San Francisco. When looking at the standards, we can see that this is mostly due to a general reduction in students in the "met" and "not met" standards, and a general increase in students in the top 2 categories. However, the percentage of students who have not met the standard, i.e. the lowest category, went only until 2017, after which it went back up to its 2015 levels.
