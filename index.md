This is the webpage showing the most important and interesting points in our analysis of the Netflix universe. The explainer notebook can be found ...

## Motivation

We've chosen a Kaggle dataset called ['Netflix Movies and TV Shows'](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows). It's a dataset containing the tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019 and is obtained from [Flixable](https://flixable.com/).

Instead of looking at the entire movie industry, we chose to look only at Netflix’s ecosystem. We believe this is more interesting, as it represents a single company’s choices rather than an entire industry. This means the network might be more connected, as Netflix actively chooses who becomes part of the network - whereas in the movie industry network, the industry doesn’t choose who makes movies and thus becomes part of the network. 

Overall, we want to get a better overview of the movie industry from a private company’s point of view. Secondly, we propose the Netflix Paradox, which says that “How does Netflix have everything, but nothing at the same time”. A problem many people can acknowledge, as it appears Netflix has every type of show, but there’s never anything you want to watch. Thirdly, as maybe the least important, but also the funniest, is trying to find out if the meme that Adam Sandler is everywhere is true (As he is a well known actor that has starred in MANY movies).
